        Structure pattern;
        Show how mount objects and classes in big projects;
        Is an object that serves as a front-facing interface;
        Mask complex implementations or structural code.

    - Strategy:
        Behavior pattern;
        Defines a family of algorithms;
        Encapsulates each algorithm as a class;
        Makes Liskov Substitution Principle more easy to implementation;
